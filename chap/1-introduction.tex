Model selection problem arise in various scientific researches. It is actually
about making decisions about which model we should use to describe the data
observed. Therefore, we insist a decision-oriented perspective of the model
selection problem. Two kinds of approaches to model selection are discussed in
this report. The first is the information-theoretic approach and the second is
the Bayesian approach. The decision-oriented perspective is applicable to both
cases as we will see in the rest of this report. It shall be noted that the
two approaches are closely related. For example a modest literal on the choice
of priors in Bayesian statistics used results from the information theory. And
some information approaches have their Bayesian interpretation.

In our own work, Bayesian model comparison, selection and averaging were
applied to a class of model called compartmental models. The results were
compared with classical model selection using (corrected) Akaike's information
criterion (\aicc). Our work is attached at the end this report. It was shown
that Bayesian modeling had significant improvement over classical information
criteria based model selection. However, there were also many difficulties and
limitations encountered in this work.

The literature review in this report serves two purpose. First, the methods we
used and those compared or contrast to, are reviewed and justified in this
report. We aim to answer questions like ``why the \aic based methods would not
work for this kind of complex models'' or ``why we need Bayesian modeling for
these models''. The second purpose is to review the computation difficulties
and limitations we met in the current work and therefore motivated our future
research on new computation techniques for Bayesian modeling.

Chapter~\ref{cha:Information-theoretic model selection} review the
information-theoretic model selection methods. They are still widely used in
many areas due to their simplicity in computation. However the limitations are
clearly demonstrated in our work and justified in this report.
Chapter~\ref{cha:Bayesian model selection} review the basic methodology of
Bayesian model comparison and selection. Chapter~\ref{cha:Bayesian computation
  with Monte Carlo methods} review Monte Carlo methods for Bayesian
computation. It will be shown that the current methods either suffers from
difficulties of implementation or unsatisfied inference results. We are
therefore motivated to seek new methods that satisfy the following criteria.
First it should be applicable to a wide range of models, with either high
dimensions or complex model specifications. Second it should be easier to
implement while give comparable results compared to some currently advanced
methods.
