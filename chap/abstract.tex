The sequential Monte Carlo (\smc) methods have been widely used for modern
scientific computation. Bayesian model comparison has been successfully
applied in many fields. Yet there has been few research done on the use of
\smc for the purpose of Bayesian model comparison. This thesis studies
different \smc strategies for Bayesian model comparison. In addition, various
extensions and refinements of existing \smc practices are proposed in this
thesis. Through empirical examples, it will be shown that the \smc strategies
can be applied for many realistic applications which might be difficult for
Markov chain Monte Carlo (\mcmc) algorithms. The extensions and refinements
also lead to an automatic, adaptive strategy. This strategy is able to produce
accurate estimates of the Bayes factor with minimal manual tuning of the
algorithms.

Another advantage of the \smc algorithms over \mcmc algorithms is that it can
be parallelized in a straightforward way. This allows the algorithms to better
utilize modern computer architectures. This thesis presents work on the
parallel implementation of the \smc algorithms. A \cpp framework within which
generic \smc algorithms can be implemented easily on parallel computers is
introduced. We show that with little additional effort, the implementations
using the framework can provide significant performance speedup.
