First and foremost, I would like to sincerely express my deepest gratitude to
my supervisors John Aston and Adam Johansen for their enthusiasm,
encouragement and for introducing me to such exciting topics. The discussions
and feedback during the course of this thesis were immensely appreciated. I
am also grateful to them both for their trust in allowing me the freedom to
follow my ideas and develop side projects.

No words can express my gratitude to my parents for all their support. Indeed
this thesis would have never been possible without the constant encouragement.
