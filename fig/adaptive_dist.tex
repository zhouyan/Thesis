  {A typical plot of $\alpha_t - \alpha_{t-1}$ against $\alpha_t$ for the
    two-compartments \pet model with the simulated data set using the \smc[2]
    algorithm. The specifications of the adaptive parameter (\ess or \cess)
    are adjusted such that all four samplers use roughly the same number of
    distributions.}
