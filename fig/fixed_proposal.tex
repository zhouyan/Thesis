  {Average random walk acceptance rates for the two-compartments \pet model with data sets in Figure~\ref{fig:typical real pet} using fixed proposal scales. The proposal scales are calibrated for a single data set other than the three shown in Figure~\ref{fig:typical real pet}. It is clear that clear that proposal scales calibrated for a single data set cannot be applied other data sets efficiently. Adaptive and automatic scheme is required in this situation.}
