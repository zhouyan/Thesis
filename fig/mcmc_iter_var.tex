  using \protect\smc algorithm]
  {Variance of the path sampling estimates and total number of samples using the \smc[2] algorithm (on logarithm scale). The variances are calculated from 100 simulations for each sampler configuration. All samplers use 1,000 particles but with different number of distributions $T$ and passes of \mcmc moves at each iteration $K$. And $TK$ is the number of total samples generated. Samplers with the same value of $TK$ have roughly the same computational cost.}
