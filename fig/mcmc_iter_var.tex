  {Variance of the path sampling estimates and total number of samples
    using the \smc[2] algorithm. Both samplers use 1,000 particles but with
    different number of distributions $T$ and passes of \mcmc moves at each
    iteration $K$. The samplers are configured such that the value of $TK$ is the same for both samplers, and therefore they generate the same total number of samples.}
