  using \protect\smc algorithm]
  {Variance of path sampling estimator and total number of samples using the \smc[2] algorithm. Multiple samplers are used to evluate the trade-off between the number of particles $N$ and the number of distributions $T$. They are configured such that the total number of samples $NT$ is a constant. In this figure, the variance of the path sampling estimator from 100 simulations of each sampler is plotted against the total number of samples $NT$ on the logarithm scale. Different configurations of $T$ are indicated with different sizes of the dots, larger dots representing larger $T$ (and thus smaller $N$). It can be seen that for a particular value of $NT$, changing $T$ may change the variance considerably and larger $T$ is preferred for most values of $NT$.}
