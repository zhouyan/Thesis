  {Convergence diagnostics for the three-compartments \pet using ratio of variance of $V_D$ estimates using final 1,000 samples to that of all 10,000 post burn-in samples. A value of the ratio close to one indicates that there are no apparent signs that the \mcmc algorithms do not converge well. A value within the range of $[0.9, 1.1]$ is considered to be acceptable.}
