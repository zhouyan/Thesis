  {Trace of $(\phi_1,\theta_1)$ from three random walk Metropolis-Hastings
  samplers for the one-compartments \pet model with non-informative priors,
  using well tuned proposal scales. The first few values of each trace is not
  shown in the plots since they are far away from the high probability region
  with an order of magnitude difference in values.}
