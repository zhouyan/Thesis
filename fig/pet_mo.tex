  {Model selection results for \pet model using real data set. From
    top to bottom: Model order selected by \aicc (see Section~\ref{sub:A
      second order aic}); Model order selected by \bic (see
    Section~\ref{sub:Bayes factor}); Model order selected by using Bayesian
    model comparison with marginal likelihood approximated by generalized
    harmonic mean estimator; The posterior model probability
    $\pi(\calM_k|\data)$ (see Section~\ref{sub:Model choice problems}) with
    uniform prior model probability $\pi(\calM_k)$.}
