  {Estimates of $V_D$ from a single \pet scan as found using \smc[2].
    The data shows that the volume of distribution exhibits substantial
    spatial variation. Note that each pixel in the image represent an estimate
    from an individual time series data set. There are approximately a quarter
    of a million of them and each requires a Monte Carlo simulation to select
    a model.}
