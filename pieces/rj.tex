  \section{Algorithm and model}

  The trans-dimensional \smc algorithm, (\rjsmc for short since it involves a
  reversible jump as well), is different from the standard \smc by the
  posterior distribution and the type of \mcmc moves between iterations. The
  posterior is now
  \begin{equation}
    \pi(\bftheta,k|\by) \propto p(k)\pi(\bftheta|k)f(\by|\bftheta,k)
  \end{equation}
  which is defined on the joint space $\cup_{k\in\K}(\bfTheta_k\times\{k\})$,
  where $\K$ is the model space and $k$ is the model indicator. In this
  particular example, the space $\K$ is defined as a set of integers
  $\{1,\dots,\kmax\}$ and the prior of $k$ is uniform on this set. The value
  of $\kmax$ is set to $100$ in the implementation. Another choice of the
  prior of $k$ is a Poisson distribution. The moves between iterations are
  constructed with one local move, which does not change the dimension and is
  the same as in the standard \smc; and two reversible jump moves. The first
  is a split or combine move. The second is a birth or death move.

  The \rjmcmc algorithm can be viewed as a special case of \rjsmc. That is,
  without resampling, and every intermediate distribution is the posterior,
  then a \rjsmc system with $n$ particles can be viewed as $n$ independent
  \rjmcmc chains. Therefore we will not make distinction between these two
  algorithms in the following discussion, except for those places that such a
  distinction is important.

  The model is the same as in \textcite{DelMoral:2006hc}, and therefore is
  slightly different from \textcite{Richardson:1997ea} in the sense that there
  is no allocation parameter involved (in other words it is integrated out
  from \textcite{Richardson:1997ea}'s model) and there is no prior for the
  scale parameter of the Gamma prior for the precision parameter. This setting
  simplifies things considerably.

  As in \textcite{Richardson:1997ea} the components are labeled such that the
  means of components are strictly increasing. That is, for components $j_1 <
  j_2$, we have $\mu_{j_1} < \mu_{j_2}$.

  \subsection{Formulation of algorithms}

  To summary the above discussion, we give the explicit formulas of the
  algorithm in \textcite{Richardson:1997ea} with adjustment to the
  parameterization without allocation parameters. As before, we denote the
  likelihood by $L(\by|\bftheta,k)$, the prior without the adjacency condition
  by $\pi(\bftheta|k)$ and prior for $k$ by $p(k)$ (since it is uniform we will
  omit this one henceforth). The first two are exactly the same as in standard
  \smc. With the adjacency condition, the prior is thus $k!\pi(\bftheta|k)$.
  The parameter $\bftheta = \{w_j, \mu_j, \lambda_j\}_{j=1}^k$, and all
  weights, means and precisions share common priors. That is, the weights
  $\{w_j\}$ follow a symmetric Dirichlet distribution with parameter $\delta =
  1$; the means $\{\mu_j\}$ follow a normal distribution with mean $\eta$ and
  variance $\sigma^2$; the precisions $\{\lambda_j\}$ follow a Gamma
  distribution with shape $\kappa$ and scale $\chi$. The prior parameters are
  estimated from the data in the same way as in \textcite{DelMoral:2006hc}.

  \subsubsection{Local moves}

  The local move is a three-blocks Metropolis-Hastings random walk. Assume
  that the particle is at state $\bftheta$ with $k$ components. First the
  means $\{\mu_j\}$ are updated with a normal random walk. Second, the
  precisions $\{\lambda_j\}$ are updated with a log-normal random walk, or in
  other words a normal random walk on the logarithm scale. Last, the weights
  $\{w_j\}$ are updated with a normal random walk on logit scale.

  \subsubsection{Split and combine moves}

  Again, assume the particle is at state $\bftheta$ with $k$ components, that
  is, $\bftheta = \{w_j, \mu_j, \lambda_j\}_{j=1}^k$. We first chose split
  with probability $b_k$, and thus combine with probability $d_k = 1 - b_k$.
  We set $b_1 = 1$, $b_{\kmax} = 0$ and $b_k = 0.5$ for $1 < k < \kmax$. If a
  combine move is chosen, then we randomly select two adjacent components, say
  $i_1 = i$ and $i_2 = i + 1$. We propose to combine them into a new component
  $i$ and move to the new state $\bftheta^*$ by the following transformation,
  \begin{align*}
    (w_j^*, \mu_j^*, \lambda_j^*) &= (w_j, \mu_j, \lambda_j)
    && \quad\text{for }j < i, \\
    (w_j^*, \mu_j^*, \lambda_j^*) &= (w_{j+1}, \mu_{j+1}, \lambda_{j+1})
    && \quad\text{for }j > i,
  \end{align*}
  and
  \begin{equation}
    \left.\begin{aligned}
      w_i^* &= w_{i_1} + w_{i_2} \\
      w_i^*\mu_i^* &= w_{i_1}\mu_{i_1} + w_{i_2}\mu_{i_2} \\
      w_i^*({\mu_i^*}^2 + {\lambda_i^*}^{-1}) &=
      w_{i_1}(\mu_{i_1}^2 + \lambda_{i_1}^{-1}) +
      w_{i_2}(\mu_{i_2}^2 + \lambda_{i_2}^{-1})
    \end{aligned}\qquad\right\}\label{eq:combine_trans}
  \end{equation}
  If a split move is chosen, then we randomly select one component, say
  component $i$, and propose to split it into two component labeled with $i_1
  = i$ and $i_2 = i + 1$, and move the state $\bftheta$ to the new state
  $\bftheta^*$,
  \begin{align*}
    (w_j^*, \mu_j^*, \lambda_j^*) &= (w_j, \mu_j, \lambda_j)
    && \quad\text{for }j < i, \\
    (w_j^*, \mu_j^*, \lambda_j^*) &= (w_{j-1}, \mu_{j-1}, \lambda_{j-1})
    && \quad\text{for }j > i + 1,
  \end{align*}
  and
  \begin{equation}
    \left.\begin{aligned}
      w_{i_1}^* &= u_1w_i & w_{i_2}^* &= (1 - u_1)w_i \\
      \mu_{i_1}^* &=
      \mu_i - u_2\sqrt{\frac{w_{i_2}^*}{w_{i_1}^*\lambda_i}} &
      \mu_{i_2}^* &=
      \mu_i + u_2\sqrt{\frac{w_{i_1}^*}{w_{i_2}^*\lambda_i}} \\
      \frac{1}{\lambda_{i_1}^*} &=
      u_3(1 - u_2^2)\frac{w_i}{w_{i_1}^*}\frac{1}{\lambda_i} &
      \frac{1}{\lambda_{i_2}^*} &=
      (1 - u_3)(1 - u_2^2)\frac{w_i}{w_{i_2}^*}\frac{1}{\lambda_i}\\
    \end{aligned}\qquad\right\}\label{eq:split_trans}
  \end{equation}
  where $u_1\sim\mathrm{Beta}(2,2)$, $u_2\sim\mathrm{Beta}(2,2)$ and
  $u_2\sim\mathrm{Beta}(1,1)$ and $\mathrm{Beta}(a,b)$ is the Beta
  distribution. It is easy to check that the split
  transformation~\eqref{eq:split_trans} satisfies the relations in the combine
  transformation~\eqref{eq:combine_trans} with suitable substitution of
  notations.

  In the split move, if $\mu_{i_1}^* < \mu_{i - 1}$ or
  $\mu_{i_2}^* > \mu_{i + 1}$, i.e., the adjacency condition is not
  met, the proposal is rejected. Otherwise, it is accepted with probability
  $\min\{1, A_s\}$, where
  \begin{align}
    A_s =& \frac{(k + 1)!}{k!}
    \frac{\pi(\bftheta^*|k + 1)L(\by|\bftheta^*,k + 1)}
    {\pi(\bftheta|k)L(\by|\bftheta,k)} \notag\\
    &\times\frac{d_{k+1}}{b_k}
    \frac{1}{f_{2,2}(u_1)f_{2,2}(u_2)f_{1,1}(u_3)} \notag\\
    &\times\frac{w_i\Abs{\mu_{i_1}^* - \mu_{i_2}^*}}
    {u_2(1 - u_2^2)u_3(1 - u_3)}
    \frac{\lambda_{i_1}^*\lambda_{i_2}^*}{\lambda_i}
  \end{align}
  where $f_{a,b}(\cdot)$ is the density of $\mathrm{Beta}(a,b)$ distribution.
  The term $d_{k+1}/b_k$ is the odd of propose a combine move from
  $\bftheta^*$ back to $\bftheta$ to the split move. The last line is the
  Jacobian of the transformation from $(\bftheta,\bu)$ to $\bftheta^*$ with
  $\bu = (u_1, u_2, u_3)$. In the combine move, we accept the proposed new
  state with probability $\min\{1,A_s^{-1}\}$ with suitable substitutions of
  notations.

  \subsubsection{Birth and death moves}

  As before suppose the particle is at state $\bftheta$ with $k$ components.
  We choose birth or death with the same probabilities $b_k$ and $d_k$ as in
  the split and combine moves. If a birth move is chosen, then we generate a
  new component with
  \begin{equation}
    w_{k+1}^* \sim \mathrm{Beta}(1, k),\qquad
    \mu_{k+1}^* \sim \mathrm{Normal}(\eta,\sigma^2),\qquad
    \lambda_{k+1}^* \sim \mathrm{Gamma}(\kappa, \chi).
  \end{equation}
  To make space for the new component we rescale the old weights $\{w_j\}$ to
  $\{w_j^*\}$ with $w_j^* = w_j(1 - w_{k+1}^*)$. The last, we rearrange the
  components to met the adjacency condition and obtain the new state
  $\bftheta^*$. When a death move is chosen, we randomly select a component
  and propose to delete it. The accept probability of accepting the birth move
  is $\min\{1,A_b\}$ with
  \begin{align}
    A_s =& \frac{(k + 1)!}{k!}
    \frac{\pi(\bftheta^*|k + 1)L(\by|\bftheta^*,k + 1)}
    {\pi(\bftheta|k)L(\by|\bftheta,k)} \notag\\
    &\times\frac{d_{k+1}}{b_k}
    \frac{1}{f_{1,k}(w_{k+1}^*)}(1-w_{k+1}^*)^k.
  \end{align}
  And the probability of accepting the death move is thus $\min\{1,A_b^{-1}\}$
  with suitable substitutions of notations.
