abstract = {Using conventional autoradiographic and tissue counting techniques, the experimental quantitation of in vivo kinetics of prospective or established radioligands for PET is animal and labour intensive. The present study tested the feasibility of using PET itself to quantitate the specific binding of [11C]raclopride to rat striatum and to study the effects of experimental manipulation of endogenous dopamine on binding parameters. Carbon-11-labeled raclopride was given i.v. to anaesthetised rats, positioned in a PET camera and dynamic emission scans acquired over 60 min. Time-activity curves were generated for selected regions of interest, representing striatum and cerebellum and the striatal data fitted to a compartmental model, using cerebellum as the input function, thus circumventing the need for individual metabolite-corrected plasma curves. In control rats, the binding potential (BP), defined as the ratio of the rate constants for transfer from "free to bound" and "bound to free" compartments, was of the order of 0.6. This was reduced threefold by predosing with nonradioactive raclopride. Increasing extracellular dopamine levels by predosing with d-amphetamine resulted in a significant decrease in BP whereas reducing extracellular dopamine by predosing with gamma-butyrolactone caused a significant increase. Thus, despite the limitation in spatial resolution of PET, specific binding of raclopride could be assessed from regional time-activity curves from individual rats. The system was sufficiently sensitive that changes in BP could be detected following modulation of endogenous dopamine levels, a finding of potential relevance to the interpretation of clinical PET data.},

abstract = {A functional smoothing approach to the analysis of PET time course data is presented. By borrowing information across space and accounting for this pooling through the use of a nonparametric covariate adjustment, it is possible to smooth the PET time course data thus reducing the noise. A new model for functional data analysis, the Multiplicative Nonparametric Random Effects Model, is introduced to more accurately account for the variation in the data. A locally adaptive bandwidth choice helps to determine the correct amount of smoothing at each time point. This preprocessing step to smooth the data then allows subsequent analysis by methods such as Spectral Analysis to be substantially improved in terms of their mean squared error.},

abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques revolutionized statistical practice in the 1990s by providing an essential toolkit for making the rigor and flexibility of Bayesian analysis computationally practical. At the same time the increasing prevalence of massive datasets and the expansion of the field of data mining has created the need for statistically sound methods that scale to these large problems. Except for the most trivial examples, current MCMC methods require a complete scan of the dataset for each iteration eliminating their candidacy as feasible data mining techniques.In this article we present a method for making Bayesian analysis of massive datasets computationally feasible. The algorithm simulates from a posterior distribution that conditions on a smaller, more manageable portion of the dataset. The remainder of the dataset may be incorporated by reweighting the initial draws using importance sampling. Computation of the importance weights requires a single scan of the remaining observations. While importance sampling increases efficiency in data access, it comes at the expense of estimation efficiency. A simple modification, based on the "rejuvenation" step used in particle filters for dynamic systems models, sidesteps the loss of efficiency with only a slight increase in the number of data accesses.To show proof-of-concept, we demonstrate the method on two examples. The first is a mixture of transition models that has been used to model web traffic and robotics. For this example we show that estimation efficiency is not affected while offering a 99% reduction in data accesses. The second example applies the method to Bayesian logistic regression and yields a 98% reduction in data accesses.},

abstract = {A method is presented for the analysis of dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) data using sparse Bayesian learning. Parameters are estimated in a compartmental framework using an over-complete exponential basis set and sparse Bayesian learning. The technique is applicable to analyses requiring either a plasma or reference tissue input function and produces estimates of the system's macro-parameters and model order. In addition, the Bayesian approach returns the posterior distribution which allows for some characterisation of the error component. The method is applied to the estimation of parametric images of neuroreceptor radioligand studies.},

abstract = {The in vivo binding kinetics of [11C]iomazenil, a central benzodiazepine antagonist, were analyzed using PET and compartmental modeling. This method is of interest because it allows validation of the SPECT tracer [123I]iomazenil. Methods: The experimental protocol consisted of serial PET imaging following a single bolus injection of the radioligand. Imaging was performed on five healthy young volunteers over 106 min. The tissue time-activity curves of various brain regions were analyzed with models consisting of two (K1, k2'') and three (K1, k2', k3', k4) compartments. Some of the methods use simultaneous fitting of the data from multiple brain regions coupled with common parameters. Distribution volumes and k3-based parameters [(K1/k2') k3' and k3')] were chosen to represent receptor density. Goodness of fit was assessed with F-test statistics and chi-square analysis. Results: Compared with the two-compartment model, goodness of fit was significantly improved by all three-compartment configurations. Of the three-compartment models, goodness of fit was similar for the configurations with K1/k2', k4 or no parameter coupled, and slightly worse when both parameters were coupled. The most reliable estimates of receptor density were obtained from the specific distribution volumes (DVs) calculated with the three-compartment model, and the coupling of k4 or both k4 and K1/k2'. Due to oversimplification of the kinetics, the DV values calculated with the two-compartment model were underestimated. Conclusion: Reliable quantitative information regarding benzodiazepine receptor density following bolus injection of iomazenil is best obtained by tracer kinetic modeling that uses a three-compartment model and parameter coupling.},

abstract = {In almost all documented applications, the normal-based Lugannani and Rice (1980) formula provides an extremely accurate approximation to tail probabilities. However, it would be wrong to conclude that this formula is always reliable. In the present paper, we consider an example, the first passage time of a random walk with drift, in which the overall performance of the normal-based Lugannani and Rice formula is rather poor. In contrast, a modified Lugannani and Rice formula, in which the normal base is replaced by an inverse Gaussian base, gives an excellent approximation. A similar modification of Barndorff-Nielsen's (1986) formula is also considered. The main focus of this paper is on a detailed study of the approximations in the extreme right tail of the distribution, and our theoretical results go some of the way towards explaining the observed numerical behaviour. However, on closer scrutiny, there is a disconcerting lack of correspondence between some of the theoretical limits and the numerical results, which appears to be due to convergence rates of some quantities being extremely slow.},

abstract = {Statistical methods of inference typically require the likelihood function to be computable
in a reasonable amount of time. The class of "likelihood-free" methods termed Approximate
Bayesian Computation (ABC) is able to eliminate this requirement, replacing the evaluation
of the likelihood with simulation from it. Likelihood-free methods have gained in efficiency
and popularity in the past few years, following their integration with Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) and Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) in order to better explore the parameter
space. They have been applied primarily to the estimation of the parameters of a given
model, but can also be used to compare models.
Here we present novel likelihood-free approaches to model comparison, based upon the
independent estimation of the evidence of each model under study. Key advantages of these
approaches over previous techniques are that they allow the exploitation of MCMC or SMC
algorithms for exploring the parameter space, and that they do not require a sampler able to
mix between models. We validate the proposed methods using a simple exponential family
problem before providing a realistic problem from population genetics: the comparison of
different growth models based upon observations of human Y chromosome data from the
terminal generation.},

We investigated the influence of this term upon CMRglc values in a series of brain tumor patients and found that significant overestimations of CMRglc are possible if the effect of CBV upon the model is ignored. The magnitude of this potential over-estimation is directly related to the absolute value of CBV locally and inversely related to the CMRglc value. The kinetic estimates also permitted an evaluation of the FDG model in an environment with a variable disruption of the blood-brain barrier. Incorporating the vascular compartment in the FDG model also frequently improved the statistical accuracy of model fits to tissue kinetic data. The sampling requirements for this model configuration were also investigated in a series of computer simulations.},

abstract = {In a 1935 paper and in his book Theory of probability, Jeffresy developed a methodology for quantifying the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. The centerpies was a number, now called the Bayes factor, which is the posterior odds of the null hypothesis when the prior probability on the null is one-half. Although there has been much discussion of Bayesian hypothesis testing in the context of criticism of P-values, less attention has been given to the Bayes as a practical tool of applied statistics. In this article we review and discuss the uses of Bayes factors in the context of five scientific applications in genetics, sports, ecology, sociology, and psychology. We emphasize the following points: From Jeffrey's Bayesian viewpoint, the purpose of hypothesis testing is to evaluate the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. Bayes factors offer a way of evaluating evidence in favor of a null hypothesis. Bayes factors provide a way of incorporating external information into the evaluation of evidence about a hypothesis. Bayes factors are very general and do not require alternative models to be nested. Several techniques are available for computing Bayes factors, including asymptotic approximations that are easy to compute using the output from standard packages that maximize likelihoods. In "non-Bayesian significance tests. The Schwarz criterion (or BIC) gives a rough approximation to the logarithm of the Bayes factor, which is easy to use and does not require evaluation of prior distributions. When one is interested in estimation or prediction, Bayes factors may be converted to weights to be attached to various models so that a composite estimate or prediction may be obtained that takes account of structural or model uncertainty. Algorithms have been proposed that allow model uncertainty to be taken into account when the class of models initially considered is very large. Bayes factors are useful for guiding an evolutionary model-building process. It is important, and feasible, to assess the sensitivity of conclusions to the prior distributions used.},

abstract = {Summary: The regional binding of the opiate receptor ligand diprenorphine has been examined in rat brain both in vivo and in vitro. The time course of total label in specific brain regions was followed up to 2 h after intravenous bolus injection of [3H]diprenorphine, with or without a pulse chase of unlabelled diprenorphine at 30 min. In addition, total label was measured 30 min after injection of labelled diprenorphine at nontracer concentrations over a range of specific activities. Total data sets for each region were fitted simultaneously to a compartmental model to give estimates of maximal binding capacity Bmax), the second-order apparent association rate constant, and the first-order dissociation rate constant of the receptor-ligand complex. The model incorporated the use of a reference region with low specific binding (cerebellum). The binding of diprenorphine to rat brain ho-mogenates was measured in vitro under equilibrium conditions at 37$\,^{\circ}$C, pH 7.4, in the presence and absence of naloxone, to give corresponding regional estimates of Bmax and the half-saturation constant Kd. The results snowed a close correlation between in vitro and in vivo regional estimates of Bmax over a wide range. There were no significant interregional differences either in Kd in vitro or in the Kd derived from the in vivo analysis, although in vitro and in vivo estimates differed by an order of magnitude. This work was carried out as part of a validation study with a view to the application of the compartmental model to data obtained in vivo in humans using positron emission tomogidphy, when successive studies over a range of specific activities are not feasible. Restriction of the rat data to tracer alone and pulse chase protocols showed that the compartmental model gave regional estimates of the combined forward rate constant consistent with estimates obtained using the complete data set},

The simplex adapts itself to the local landscape, and contracts on to the final minimum. The method is shown to be effective and computationally compact. A procedure is given for the estimation of the Hessian matrix in the neighbourhood of the minimum, needed in statistical estimation problems.},

abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for Bayesian computation have until recently been restricted to problems where the joint distribution of all variables has a density with respect to some fixed standard underlying measure. They have therefore not been available for application to Bayesian model determination, where the dimensionality of the parameter vector is typically not fixed. This paper proposes a new framework for the construction of reversible Markov chain samplers that jump between parameter subspaces of differing dimensionality, which is flexible and entirely constructive. It should therefore have wide applicability in model determination problems. The methodology is illustrated with applications to multiple change-point analysis in one and two dimensions, and to a Bayesian comparison of binomial experiments.},

abstract = {The Kalman filter provides an effective solution to the linear Gaussian filtering problem. However where there is nonlinearity, either in the model specification or the observation process, other methods are required. Methods known generically as `particle filters' are considered. These include the condensation algorithm and the Bayesian bootstrap or sampling importance resampling (SIR) filter. These filters represent the posterior distribution of the state variables by a system of particles which evolves and adapts recursively as new information becomes available. In practice, large numbers of particles may be required to provide adequate approximations and for certain applications, after a sequence of updates, the particle system will often collapse to a single point. A method of monitoring the efficiency of these filters is introduced which provides a simple quantitative assessment of sample impoverishment and the authors show how to construct improved particle filters that are both structurally efficient in terms of preventing the collapse of the particle system and computationally efficient in their implementation. This is illustrated with the classic bearings-only tracking problem},

abstract = {As the discipline of functional neuroimaging grows there is an increasing interest in meta analysis of brain imaging studies. A typical neuroimaging meta analysis collects peak activation coordinates (foci) from several studies and identifies areas of consistent activation. Most imaging meta analysis methods only produce null hypothesis inferences and do not provide an interpretable fitted model. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Bayesian spatial hierarchical model using a marked independent cluster process. We model the foci as offspring of a latent study center process, and the study centers are in turn offspring of a latent population center process. The posterior intensity function of the population center process provides inference on the location of population centers, as well as the inter-study variability of foci about the population centers. We illustrate our model with a meta analysis consisting of 437 studies from 164 publications, show how two subpopulations of studies can be compared and assess our model via sensitivity analyses and simulation studies. Supplemental materials are available online.},

It can be used to evaluate likelihood functions and byproducts thereof, such as ML estimators, for models which depend upon unobservable variables. A dynamic stochastic volatility model and a logit panel data model with unobserved heterogeneity (random effects) in both dimensions are used to provide illustrations of EIS high numerical accuracy, even under small number of MC draws. MC simulations are used to characterize the finite sample numerical and statistical properties of EIS-based ML estimators.},

abstract = {The differential equations of compartmental analysis form the basis of the models describing the uptake of tracers used in imaging studies. Graphical analyses convert the model equations into linear plots, the slopes of which represent measures of tracer binding. The graphical methods are not dependent upon a particular model structure but the slopes can be related to combinations of the model parameters if a model structure is assumed. The input required is uptake data from a region of interest vs time and an input function that can either be plasma measurements or uptake data from a suitable reference region. Graphical methods can be applied to both reversible and irreversibly binding tracers. They provide considerable ease of computation compared to the optimization of individual model parameters in the solution of the differential equations generally used to describe the binding of tracers. Conditions under which the graphical techniques are applicable and some problems encountered in separating tracer delivery and binding are considered. Also the effect of noise can introduce a bias in the distribution volume which is the slope of the graphical analysis of reversible tracers. Smoothing techniques may minimize this problem and retain the model independence. In any case graphical techniques can provide insight into the binding kinetics of tracers in a visual way.},

abstract = {Ways of obtaining approximate Bayes factors for generalised linear models are described, based on the Laplace method for integrals. We propose a new approximation which uses only the output of standard computer programs for estimating generalised linear models, this appears to be quite accurate. A reference set of proper priors is suggested, both to represent the situation where there is not much prior information, and to assess the sensitivity of the results to the prior distribution. The methods can be used when the dispersion parameter is unknown, when there is overdispersion, to compare link functions, and to compare error distributions and variance functions. The methods can be used to implement the Bayesian approach to accounting for model uncertainty. We describe an applciation to inference about relative risks in the presence of control factors where model uncertainty is large and important. Software to implement the methods is available at no cost from StatLib.},

We argue that the cusum path plot can bring out, more effectively than the sequential plot, those aspects of a Markov sampler which tell the user how quickly or slowly the sampler is moving around in its sample space, in the direction of the summary statistic. The proposal is then illustrated in four examples which represent situations where the cusum path plot works well and not well. Moreover, a rigorous analysis is given for one of the examples. We conclude that the cusum path plot is an effective tool for convergence diagnostics of a Markov sampler and for comparing different Markov samplers.},

abstract = {Carbon-11-thymidine is a PET tracer of DNA synthesis and cellular proliferation. Quantitative analysis of [11C]thymidine images is complicated by the presence of significant quantities of labeled metabolites. Estimation of the rate of thymidine incorporation into DNA using [11C]thymidine requires a kinetic model that is capable of describing the behavior of thyrnkiine and labeled metabolites. Methods: Based on previous studies @Mth labeled thymidine,we constructed a five-compartment model describing the kinetic behavior of 2-[11C]thymidine and its labeled metabolites. In addition, we have performed a series of calculations and simulations to calculate the sensitivity and identifiability of model parameters to estimate the extent to which individual parameters can be estimated; to determine appropriate model constraints necessary for reproducible estimates of the constant describing flux of thymidine from the blood into DNA, i.e., thymidine flux constant; and to determinethe potential accuracy of model parameter and thymidine flux constant estimates from PET imaging data. Results: The underlying assumptions in the thymidine compartmental model lead to a description of the thymidine flux constant for DNA incorporation in terms of model parameters. Sensitivity and identifiability analyses suggest that the model parameters pertaining to labeled metabolites will be difficult to estimate independently of the thymidine parameters. Exact evaluation of the kinetic parameters of the labeled metabolites is not the principal goal of this model. Simulations were performed that suggest that it is preferable to tightly constrain these parameters to preset values near the center of their expected ranges. Although it is difficult to estimate individual thymidine model parameters, the flux constant for incorporation into DNA can be accurately estimated (r > 0.9 for estimated versus true simulated flux constant). Rux constant estimates are not affected by modest levels of local degradation of thymidine that may occur in proliferating tissue. Conclusion: By using a kinetic model for thymidine and labeled metabolites, it is possible to estimate the flux of thymidine uptake and incorporation into DNA and, thereby, noninvasively estimate regional cellular proliferation using [11C]thymidine and PET.},

abstract = {The reference tissue model allows for quantification of receptor kinetics without measuring the arterial input function, thus avoiding arterial cannulation and time-consuming metabolite measurements. The model contains four parameters, of which the binding potential (BP) is the parameter of interest. Although BP is robust, convergence rates are slow and the other parameters can have large standard errors. To overcome this problem, a simplified reference tissue containing only three parameters was developed. This new three-parameter model was compared with the previous four-parameter model using a variety of PET studies: [11C]SCH 23390 (D1 receptor) and [11C]raclopride (D2 receptor) in humans, and [11C]SCH 23390, [11C]raclopride and [11C]RTI-121 (dopamine transporter) in rats. The BP values obtained from both models were essentially the same for all cases. In addition, the three-parameter model was insensitive to starting values, produced stable results for the other parameters (small standard errors), and converged rapidly. In conclusion, for the ligands tested the three-parameter model is a better choice, combining increased convergence rate with increased stability.},

abstract = {Undirected graphical models are widely used in statistics, physics and machine vision. However Bayesian parameter estimation for undirected models is extremely challenging, since evaluation of the posterior typically involves the calculation of an intractable normalising constant. This problem has received much attention, but very little of this has focussed on the important practical case where the data consists of noisy or incomplete observations of the underlying hidden structure. This paper specifically addresses this problem, comparing two alternative methodologies. In the first of these approaches particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (Andrieu et al., 2010) is used to efficiently explore the parameter space, combined with the exchange algorithm (Murray et al., 2006) for avoiding the calculation of the intractable normalising constant (a proof showing that this combination targets the correct distribution in found in a supplementary appendix online). This approach is compared with approximate Bayesian computation (Pritchard et al., 1999). Applications to estimating the parameters of Ising models and exponential random graphs from noisy data are presented. Each algorithm used in the paper targets an approximation to the true posterior due to the use of MCMC to simulate from the latent graphical model, in lieu of being able to do this exactly in general. The supplementary appendix also describes the nature of the resulting approximation.},

One of the two commonly used methods ignores physiological processes including blood flow that occur at the same time as radioactive decay; the other makes incorrect use of time-accumulated PET counts. In simulated dynamic PET studies using 11C-acetate and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), these methods are shown to result in biased estimates of the time-activity curve (TAG) and model parameters. New methods described in this article provide significantly improved parameter estimates in dynamic PET studies},

General theory is derived and the systems are characterized in terms of their impulse response functions. The theory shows that the macro parameters of the system may be determined simply from the coefficients of the impulse response functions. These results are discussed in the context of radioligand binding studies. It is shown that binding potential is simply related to the integral of the impulse response functions for all plasma and reference tissue input models currently used in PET. This article also introduces a general compartmental description for the behavior of the tracer in blood, which then allows for the blood volume-induced bias in reference tissue input models to be assessed.},

abstract = {Mass spectrometry (MS) has shown great potential in detecting disease-related biomarkers for early diagnosis of stroke. To discover potential biomarkers from large volume of noisy MS data, peak detection must be performed first. This article proposes a novel automatic peak detection method for the stroke MS data. In this method, a mixture model is proposed to model the spectrum. Bayesian approach is used to estimate parameters of the mixture model, and Markov chain Monte Carlo method is employed to perform Bayesian inference. By introducing a reversible jump method, we can automatically estimate the number of peaks in the model. Instead of separating peak detection into substeps, the proposed peak detection method can do baseline correction, denoising and peak identification simultaneously. Therefore, it minimizes the risk of introducing irrecoverable bias and errors from each substep. In addition, this peak detection method does not require a manually selected denoising threshold. Experimental results on both simulated dataset and stroke MS dataset show that the proposed peak detection method not only has the ability to detect small signal-to-noise ratio peaks, but also greatly reduces false detection rate while maintaining the same sensitivity.},

abstract = {This article deals with the problem of model selection for the mathematical description of tracer kinetics in nuclear medicine. It stems from the consideration of some specific data sets where different models have similar performances. In these situations, it is shown that considerate averaging of a parameter's estimates over the entire model set is better than obtaining the estimates from one model only. Furthermore, it is also shown that the procedure of averaging over a small number of "good" models reduces the "generalization error," the error introduced when the model selected over a particular data set is applied to different conditions, such as subject populations with altered physiologic parameters, modified acquisition protocols, and different signal-to-noise ratios. The method of averaging over the entire model set uses Akaike coefficients as measures of an individual model's likelihood. To facilitate the understanding of these statistical tools, the authors provide an introduction to model selection criteria and a short technical treatment of Akaike's information--theoretic approach. The new method is illustrated and epitomized by a case example on the modeling of [11C]flumazenil kinetics in the brain, containing both real and simulated data.},

abstract = {The particle filter (PF) was introduced in 1993 as a numerical approximation to the nonlinear Bayesian filtering problem, and there is today a rather mature theory as well as a number of successful applications described in literature. This tutorial serves two purposes: to survey the part of the theory that is most important for applications and to survey a number of illustrative positioning applications from which conclusions relevant for the theory can be drawn. The theory part first surveys the nonlinear filtering problem and then describes the general PF algorithm in relation to classical solutions based on the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and the point mass filter (PMF). Tuning options, design alternatives, and user guidelines are described, and potential computational bottlenecks are identified and remedies suggested. Finally, the marginalized (or Rao-Blackwellized) PF is overviewed as a general framework for applying the PF to complex systems. The application part is more or less a stand-alone tutorial without equations that does not require any background knowledge in statistics or nonlinear filtering. It describes a number of related positioning applications where geographical information systems provide a nonlinear measurement and where it should be obvious that classical approaches based on Kalman filters (KFs) would have poor performance. All applications are based on real data and several of them come from real-time implementations. This part also provides complete code examples.},

abstract = {A simple formula for the conditional distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator given a maximal ancillary statistic is discussed and exemplified. The formula is generally accurate to order O(n-\theta\\theta\l) or even O(n-\theta\\theta\3/2), and for many important models it is, in fact, exact. After some preliminary discussion of the formula and of certain relevant aspects of likelihood, the formula is used to motivate the definition of a modified profile likelihood whose inferential properties are illustrated. The question of when the distribution formula is exact is considered, and in this connexion several new examples of exactness, including a bivariate generalization of the inverse Gaussian distribution, are adduced. The formula is shown also to be exact for arbitrary transformation models. To prove this it has been necessary to extend the basic theory of transformation models to cover the cases where the group action is not free. This extension, which appears of interest in itself, also allows of a generalization of a useful formula for the marginal likelihood for the index parameter of a composite transformation model.},

abstract = {Our article deals with Bayesian inference for a general state space model with the simulated likelihood computed by the particle filter. We show empirically that the partially or fully adapted particle filters can be much more efficient than the standard particle, especially when the signal to noise ratio is high. This is especially important because using the particle filter within MCMC sampling is O(T^2), where T is the sample size. We also show that an adaptive independent proposal for the unknown parameters based on a mixture of normals can be much more efficient than the usual optimal random walk methods because the simulated likelihood is not continuous in the parameters and the cost of constructing a good adaptive proposal is negligible compared to the cost of evaluating the simulated likelihood. Independent \MH proposals are also attractive because they are easy to run in parallel on multiple processors. The article also shows that the proposed \aimh sampler converges to the posterior distribution. We also show that the marginal likelihood of any state space model can be obtained in an efficient and unbiased manner by using the \pf making model comparison straightforward. Obtaining the marginal likelihood is often difficult using other methods. Finally, we prove that the simulated likelihood obtained by the auxiliary particle filter is unbiased. This result is fundamental to using the particle for MCMC sampling and is first obtained in a more abstract and difficult setting by Del Moral (2004). However, our proof is direct and will make the result accessible to readers.},
